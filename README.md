# Scaling Websockets in Python

Scaling websockets across multiple servers is not as straightforward as with a typical REST API.
Generally, a websocket client opens up a connection to the server and reuses it. This connection stays open with the same server until it is closed.  
When we cluster servers, the load-balancer manages the distribution between instances and each websocket connection is bound to a specific instance.  
The challenge lies with this stateful connection between a client and an instance. 

The easiest option is to introduce communication between different instances is a publish/subscribe broker. We use pub/sub channels in [Redis](https://redis.io/docs/manual/pubsub/). 
Instead of sending messages to the websocket client right away, we publish them on a channel and then handle them separately. By doing this, weâ€™re sure that the message is published to every instance and then sent to clients.
We also use [websockets](https://pypi.org/project/websockets/) module which handles opening and closing handshakes, pings and pongs between clients and servers.

1. When the client connects to an instance via a websocket connection, the server subscribes the user to a Redis channel (named the user's username).  

2. When the back-end wants to send a message to the user, it checks if a channel with user's username exists. If it does, it will publish the message to the channel.  

3. As the subscribed user checks the channel continuously, it will get the message and sends it to the client via the open websocket connection.  

4. When the connection between the client and server closes, the user unsubscribe from the Redis channel and closes the Redis pub/sub connection.

## Dependency Installations
To run the project, install the dependencies using the command below:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Also, create a `logs` folder in the project root where logs are saved.

## Testing Websocket connections
You can use a client sample code in `tests` folder to see how the opening/closing connections are implemented.
